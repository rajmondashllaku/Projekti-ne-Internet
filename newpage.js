Ninth episodes are known for unexpected twists and turns in Game of Thrones. So, how did we miss this? We had seen some unexpected, surprising and shocking deaths earlier in the twenty-eight episodes. So how could this be better? The answer is one man George RR Martin. It takes extraordinary writing skills to write a twist that will take the viewers by surprise but it takes more to write something that is so unexpected and also makes perfect sense if they rewatch the previous episodes. A wedding turned to a massacre, A pregnant woman stabbed in the belly, A mother of five killed by slitting her throat, A king killed after hearing “The Lannisters send their regards” and to top it all the creepy “Rains of Castamere” playing in the background. If Ned Stark’s beheading caught us off guard then the Red wedding caught us by our balls.";

Yep, He has killed someone before. But, this one really caught us off guard. Kate Mara was shown as one of the central characters of the season in the promotions. In the first episode of the second season Frank Underwood asks her to meet him at a railway station. Everything goes well until, out of where Frank pushes his in front of the train. That was the moment when House of Cards earned a reputation as one of the greatest shows of all time, because it not only showed how crazy this show will be, it set the mood right for the entire season 2. This may sound partial but killing of one of the three main character in the first episode of a season requires guts that even Game of Thrones doesn’t have."

Mr.Robot is a computerised version of Fight Club, Agreed. You could’ve seen it coming right from the first episode that Mr Robot was indeed a hallucination and was no one real, Agreed. But the fact that Mr.Robot’s hallucination is just the residual version of the memories of his father was fascinating in itself. To it add another twist that Darlene was actually his sister. Hands down, this was the mind f*cking series I have ever seen.";

But the moment Walter breaks bad is when he lets Jane die. While waking Jesse up, he inadvertently flips Jane onto her back and she starts asphyxiating on her vomit due to an overdose. Walter could’ve saved her. All it could’ve required was for him to wake her up. But he stands there doing nothing. He lets her die because it could help him gain full control over Jesse and also stop Jesse from doing drugs. She was innocent and Jesse was fully in love with him. He lets her die just because she was a threat to his business. This twist in character of Walter not only sends Jesse down a spiral it formed a basement for other cruel, spineless deeds that Walter was going to commit.";

One of the main reasons for that is a brilliant antagonist in the form of Ice Truck killer. We as audience are shown who the Ice Truck Killer is far earlier than Dexter does. So there is not going to be a final twist in store when Dexter meets Rudy. You could not be more wrong. We are in for a roller coaster of twists and turns and the two most important of them being Harry was having an affair with Dexter’s mom and Rudy is Brian Moser who is the elder brother of Dexter Morgan. Yes, you read that right. Dexter had an elder brother who was not shown visions of his traumatic childhood that appeared countless times in the season. We are left as shocked and surprised as Dexter is and this stupendous writing is one of the reasons why Dexter is one of the most celebrated TV shows of this century.";

The finale saved the best for the last. It was Eurus who was behind Moriarty all the time and Sherlock’s childhood dog “Redbeard” was actually his childhood friend who was killed by Eurus. Sherlock may or may not return for another season but I’d say the splendid writing of the last season has created some insanely unmatchable standards.";

Carrie is immediately revealed that the turned PoW is not Nick but his partner Walker is the terrorist. But again it is revealed that they both are in it together and Walker is just attracting the spotlight so that Nick can kill the Vice President in suicide blast, which Nick couldn’t because of the minimal amount of humanity present in him.";

Theresa was one of the show’s most complex characters and we were just warming up to watching her and her death by the hands of Bernard(who is also revealed to be a robot) and Ford erasing her from Bernard left us spellbound. It’s after all true that every show has its “Red Wedding” moment.";
